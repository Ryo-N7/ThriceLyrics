The weight of the world is on my shoulders
And it's just too much to bear.
It's not that I'm growing callous,
I'm just too tired to care.
So drop your expectations,
Let go of any dependencies,
Forget your disapproval
'Cause I'm setting myself free.
Looking up to me,
Looking down on me,
And hazarding those sidelong glances.
I'm not too sure of what they see.
All I know is their views are slanted.
So drop your expectations,
Let go of any dependencies,
Forget your disapproval
'Cause I'm setting myself free.

Now sheltered in shadows,
The quiet song of your breath stirs the dark
Your skin like a rose 'neath my hand
And I can't keep from wondering 
Why nothing good could ever stay
Why faith feels like a fistful of sand
It's gonna rain, it's gonna rain, till the levee breaks
A tidal wave of fear and pain carries us away
Another fight into the night until nothing else remains
How do we find harbor from the hurricane?[x2]

We wave our flags, we swallow fear like medicine
We kiss the hands of profiteers and their congressmen
But I've seen too much (of this fear and hate)
Yeah I've had enough (and I'm not afraid)
To raise a shout, to make it clear  this has to end
There's blood on the sand, there's blood in the street
And there's a gun in my hand, or there might as well be
And I'm sick of it, I'm so sick of it
We panic at the sight of different colored skin
We've got a plan to justify each mess we're in
But I've seen too much (of this fear and hate)
I've had enough (and I'm not afraid)
To take a stand, to make it right  this has to end
There's blood on the sand, there's blood in the street
And there's a gun in my hand, or there might as well be
And I'm sick of it, I'm so sick of it
Fear will kill your mind and steal your love as sure as anything
Fear will rob you blind and make you numb to others' suffering
And I've felt its touch too many times and I've had enough
I've had enough!
There's blood on the sand, there's blood in the street
And there's a gun in your hand, or there might as well be
Are you sick of it? I'm so sick of it

All that I've known's within the walls of this room where there's a window
Roughly boarded up
It's true the gaps are patched but even through the tiny cracks, I feel a wind blow
I see a light of strangest hue
There's nothing I can say
There's no way I can prove
That there's a place
Beyond this room
But still, there's something in the way
The light comes shining through
And in the way
The curtains move
Late in the night I lay awake
With my eyes fixed on the window
I strained my ears until I thought
That I might have heard a song
Somehow hiding in the soft glow
Old as time and ever new
There's nothing I can say
There's no way I can prove
That there's a place
Beyond this room
But still, there's something in the way
The light comes shining through
And in the way
The curtains move
I found a note scratched in the wall
In a pained and earnest scrawl
The hand I recognized was somehow mine
I read each line with dread
There's no wind and there's no light
There's no song you hear at night
There's nowhere to hide, be terrified
It's all inside your head
But still, there's something in the way
The light comes shining through
And in the way
In the way the curtains move

Just a little sleep, a little slumber
Little folding of the hands to rest
That's what we tell ourselves
But we know we're gonna just 
Lay here till the sun's gone west
But there are foxes in the garden
And there's an armed man at the door
When the wind is right, and the skies show favor
When the heat has died and the day is cool
We tell ourselves that we'll do it later
But we know full well that that ain't true
And now there's wolves at every window
The mob is breaking down the door
Come on, we gotta wake up
We gotta wake up
We gotta wake up
I hear them coming back for more
Gotta wake up
Oh, we say we'll do it when things settle down,
we say we'll do it when this season's through
We say we'll do it when we get around to it
But it's already overdue
And there are foxes in the garden
And there's an armed man at the door
Tomorrow's song is a siren singing,
Such a sweet and subtle lullaby
Tomorrow's song has got us clinging
To the promise of the by and by
And now there's wolves at every window

The tyranny of deterioration
It worries me that it's all just a waste of time
Taking one step forward, two steps back
Still I believe there's a thread through the thorns
And I believe that somewhere it's warm
And I believe that it's ever bright beyond this black
So keep holding on to hope without assurance
Holding on to a memory of light
But will the morning come? For all I know
Well never see the sun, but together well fight the long defeat
The suffering that I see all around
It's enough to keep me crashing down till I
I lie wrecked and reeling from these falls
Still I believe there's a word in the wire
And I believe there's a way through the fire
And I believe there's a joy that blooms beyond these walls
So keep holding on to hope without assurance
Holding on to a memory of light
But will the morning come? For all I know
Well never see the sun, but together well fight the long defeat

You were a silhouette, a shivering shadow in the mingled ash and snow
I took your fevered hands - felt like embers of the world's dying glow
And you were feather light as I carried you quietly through the crumbling streets
And in the fading light I could see in your eyes that somehow we were meant to meet
Would you stay with me
If you thought the war was over
And everything made right?
Would you still believe in us
Or would your love for me grow colder
With no one left to fight?
Would you stay with me?
Would you stay with me?
After the fever left, together we'd scavenge through the city and her scars
And when the day would end, bar the door against the demons and the dark
We'd share a can of something and the bottle of bourbon I had hid away
It'd warm me from within, and you from without till I'd forget the chill and grey
Would you stay with me
If you thought the war was over
And everything made right?
Would you still believe in us
Or would your love for me grow colder
With no one left to fight?
Would you stay with me?
Would you stay with me?
Oh, it seems like every night
I lie in bed and worry that the world will start to heal
And now I'm terrified
That if it did you'd start to ask if what we have is real
Would you stay with me
If you thought the war was over
And everything made right?
Would you still believe in us
Or would your love for me grow colder

Till thick veils of indigo signaled the end of the day
